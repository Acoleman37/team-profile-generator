# team-profile-generator

A command-line application that accepts user input when I am prompted for my team members and their information then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input. When I click on an email address in the HTML then my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address, when I click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab and when I start the application then I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team. When I decide to finish building my team then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
